= How to create a new tomcat base instance

----
mkdir my-tomcat
cd my-tomcat
cp -r $CATALINA_HOME/conf .
mkdir temp
export CATALINA_BASE=`pwd`
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh run
----

NOTES:
- You normally want to install original Tomcat package into $HOME/apps/apache-tomcat (or link it) and
  no need to modify this districution package.
- To create new instance of Tocmat with your own configuration, it's recommend you create new base instance.  
- The minimal structure you need in a base instance are `conf` and `temp` folders.
- The minimal configuration files you need in `conf` folder are `web.xml` and `server.xml` with the following:
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">  
  <Service name="Catalina">
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" />
    <Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost">		
      <Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps" unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">
      </Host>
    </Engine>
  </Service>
</Server>
